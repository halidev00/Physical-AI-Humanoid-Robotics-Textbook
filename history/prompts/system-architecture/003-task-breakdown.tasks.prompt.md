## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown with 137 tasks organized by user story priority for independent implementation and testing.

**Task Organization** (9 Phases):
1. **Phase 1: Setup** (4 tasks) - Monorepo initialization
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (16 tasks) - Backend + frontend foundation, BLOCKS all user stories
3. **Phase 3: US4 - Content Generation** (32 tasks) - Generate 40-60 Markdown chapters (P1, MVP prerequisite)
4. **Phase 4: US1 - Read Content** (10 tasks) - Docusaurus display with minimalist UI (P1, MVP)
5. **Phase 5: US2 - RAG Chatbot** (22 tasks) - Backend embedding pipeline + RAG service (P2, MVP)
6. **Phase 6: US3 - Text Selection** (11 tasks) - Context-aware queries (P3, enhancement)
7. **Phase 7: Chat UI Integration** (16 tasks) - Frontend chat widget + backend connection
8. **Phase 8: Deployment** (16 tasks) - GitHub Pages + containerized backend
9. **Phase 9: Polish** (10 tasks) - Documentation, optimization, security

**User Story Mapping**:
- **US1 (P1)**: Read Technical Book Content → 10 tasks (T053-T062) - Frontend display
- **US2 (P2)**: Search with AI Assistant → 22 tasks (T063-T084) - Backend RAG system
- **US3 (P3)**: Text Selection Queries → 11 tasks (T085-T095) - Selection context
- **US4 (P1)**: Generate Book Content → 32 tasks (T021-T052) - Content generation (MVP prerequisite)

**Critical Path** (22-30 days, single developer):
Setup (1d) → Foundational (2-3d) → Content Generation/US4 (5-7d) → RAG Backend/US2 (5-7d) → Text Selection/US3 (2-3d) → Chat UI (3-4d) → Deployment (2-3d)

**Dependency Graph**:
```
Foundational (Phase 2) - REQUIRED FIRST
    ↓
US4 (Content Generation) - BLOCKS US1/US2
    ↓
    ├─→ US1 (Read Content) - CAN RUN IN PARALLEL WITH US2
    └─→ US2 (RAG Chatbot) - CAN RUN IN PARALLEL WITH US1
            ↓
        US3 (Text Selection) - DEPENDS ON US2
            ↓
        Chat UI Integration - COMBINES US2 + US3
            ↓
        Deployment
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks marked [P] - all parallel
- Phase 2 (Foundational): Backend (10 tasks) + Frontend (6 tasks) can run in parallel
- Phase 3 (US4): 24 content generation tasks marked [P] - batch generation
- After US4: US1 (frontend) and US2 (backend) can run in parallel
- Phase 9 (Polish): 10 tasks marked [P] - all parallel

**MVP Scope** (Phases 1-5 + 7-8):
- US4: Content Generation (prerequisite)
- US1: Read Content (display)
- US2: RAG Chatbot (search)
- Chat UI Integration
- Deployment
- **Total MVP**: 100 tasks, delivers readable documentation with AI chatbot

**Success Criteria Mapping**:
- SC-001 (navigation <10s): T124 validation task
- SC-002 (response <3s): T084, T110 validation tasks
- SC-003 (90% accuracy): T082 validation task
- SC-004 (zero hallucinations): T083 validation task
- SC-005 (100 concurrent users): T111 validation task
- SC-007 (90% content pass rate): T049 validation task
- SC-009 (99.5% uptime): T127 validation task
- SC-010 (95% selection focus): T095 validation task

**Format Compliance**:
- All 137 tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Task IDs sequential: T001-T137
- 67 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- 75 tasks labeled with [US1], [US2], [US3], or [US4]
- All tasks include specific file paths for implementation

**Independent Testability**:
- Each user story phase has "Checkpoint" with validation criteria
- US1 checkpoint: Verify static site navigation and rendering
- US2 checkpoint: Test RAG accuracy and zero hallucinations via API
- US3 checkpoint: Validate selected-text queries focus on highlighted content
- US4 checkpoint: Validate structure and consistency of generated content

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation. Enables MVP-first delivery (US4 + US1 + US2) followed by incremental enhancements (US3). Clear critical path and parallel opportunities identified.
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation passed (137/137 tasks follow checklist format), dependency graph validated (critical path: Setup → Foundational → US4 → US2 → US3 → Integration → Deployment)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md (598 lines) with 137 tasks across 9 phases
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks in order, or manually implement MVP scope (Phases 1-5 + 7-8)
- 🧠 Reflection: Task organization by user story enables independent development and testing. US4 (Content Generation) correctly identified as MVP prerequisite blocking US1/US2. Parallel opportunities maximize efficiency (67 [P] tasks). Critical path estimation (22-30 days) provides realistic timeline for single developer.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (137/137 tasks follow checklist format), Dependency graph - PASS (critical path identified, no circular dependencies)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user-provided task group guidance
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding estimated hours per task for more precise timeline planning. Current estimation is phase-level (days) rather than task-level (hours).
