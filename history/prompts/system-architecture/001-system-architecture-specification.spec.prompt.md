## Prompt

Define all system specifications before any implementation.

====================================
SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

1. Frontend (Documentation)
   - Location: frontend/
   - Framework: Docusaurus
   - Package Manager: pnpm
   - UI Goals:
     - Minimalist
     - Clean typography
     - Low visual noise
   - Content:
     - Generated Markdown files
     - Organized into chapters and modules
     - Sidebar-driven navigation

2. Backend (RAG Chatbot)
   - Location: backend/
   - Framework: FastAPI
   - Vector Store: Qdrant Cloud
   - Embeddings:
     - Generated from Markdown book content
   - Database:
     - Optional metadata & conversation storage

3. Chatbot Frontend Integration
   - Chat UI Library: @openai/chatkit-react
   - Embedded directly into Docusaurus pages
   - Supports:
     - Full-book context queries
     - Selected-text-only queries

4. AI Layer
   - OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDKs
   - Strict RAG enforcement (no hallucinations)

====================================
CONTENT SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

- Book title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Audience: Technical developers and AI engineers
- Style: Clear, technical, structured
- Each chapter must include:
  - Concepts
  - Architectures
  - Algorithms
  - Real-world considerations

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive system specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Interactive Textbook Platform with:

**User Stories (4 prioritized scenarios)**:
- P1: Read Technical Book Content - Core documentation access with minimalist UI
- P2: Search Book Content with AI Assistant - RAG-powered Q&A with source citations
- P3: Context-Aware Text Selection Queries - Targeted assistance for highlighted passages
- P1: Generate Complete Book Content - Automated chapter generation with required structure

**Functional Requirements (29 total)**:
- Frontend: 6 requirements covering documentation serving, navigation, and chat integration
- Backend: 9 requirements for RAG system, embeddings, vector storage, and API security
- Chatbot Integration: 7 requirements for UI components, conversation management, and error handling
- Content Generation: 7 requirements for chapter creation, validation, and consistency

**Key Entities (7 defined)**:
- Chapter, Module, Embedding, Query, Response, Conversation Session, Content Template

**Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes)**:
- Navigation performance: <10 seconds to any chapter
- Chatbot response time: <3 seconds for 95% of queries
- Accuracy: 90% RAG answer accuracy, zero hallucinations
- Scalability: 100 concurrent users without degradation
- Content quality: 90% first-generation pass rate
- Uptime: 99.5% availability

**Additional sections**:
- 8 edge cases covering failure modes and boundary conditions
- Key assumptions about content workflow, infrastructure, and audience
- Out of scope items (11 features excluded from initial release)
- Dependencies on external services (Qdrant Cloud, OpenAI API)
- 5 risk-mitigation pairs for accuracy, availability, cost, quality, and context issues

**Quality Validation**:
Created specification quality checklist with 13 validation criteria. All checks passed:
- No implementation details in requirements
- Focused on user value and business needs
- Technology-agnostic success criteria
- Testable and unambiguous requirements
- Complete edge case coverage
- Clear scope boundaries

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete system architecture specification ready for planning phase. Establishes foundation for multi-component platform (frontend, backend, chatbot, content generation).
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality validation completed - all 13 checklist items passed
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (218 lines) and requirements.md checklist (67 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to design implementation architecture, or `/sp.clarify` for additional refinement
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances technical precision with technology-agnostic requirements. Priority assignments ensure MVP viability (P1 stories can be independently developed/deployed). Success criteria provide clear measurable targets without prescribing implementation approaches.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification completed successfully on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - PASS (13/13 criteria)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with comprehensive system description
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding performance budgets for specific operations (embedding generation time, vector search latency) in planning phase
